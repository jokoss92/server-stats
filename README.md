# Usage
Make sure the script is executable. To do this, you need to run:
```bash
chmod +x server-stats.sh
```

Then, you can run the script on any Linux system as follows:
```bash
./server-stats.sh
```

This project is part of [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats) DevOps projects.
Also I explain this script in my [Medium](https://bit.ly/tugas-devops-bash)
